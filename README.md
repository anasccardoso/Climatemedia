# ClimateMedia 

The project (https://climatemediaproject.wordpress.com/) aims to understand the extent to which climate change phenomena are reported by social media users (Twitter) and how those users perceive climatic impacts on several ecological and socioeconomic dimensions. It also seeks to understand how divergent/congruent such reports and perceptions from social media users are to the scientific evidence published on the theme.

This repository contains the natural language processing models developed to exclude irrelevant posts, as well as the analyses implemented to investigate users' perceptions on climate change and related phenomena (i.e., time series, sentiment, emotion and irony analysis/detection).
