#ClimateMedia 

The project aims to understand the extent to which climate change phenomena are reported by social media users and how those users perceive climatic impacts on several ecological and socioeconomic dimensions. It also seeks to understand how divergent/congruent such reports and perceptions from social media users are to the scientific evidence published on the theme.
